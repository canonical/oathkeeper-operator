# Contributing

## Overview

This document explains the processes and practices recommended for contributing
enhancements to this operator.

- Generally, before developing bugs or enhancements to this charm, you
  should [open an issue](https://github.com/canonical/oathkeeper-operator/issues)
  explaining your use case.
- If you would like to chat with us about charm development, you can reach
  us
  at [Canonical Matrix public channel](https://matrix.to/#/#charmhub-charmdev:ubuntu.com)
  or [Discourse](https://discourse.charmhub.io/).
- Familiarising yourself with
  the [Charmed Operator Framework](https://juju.is/docs/sdk) library will help
  you a lot when working on new features or bug fixes.
- All enhancements require review before being merged. Code review typically
  examines
  - code quality
  - test coverage
  - user experience for Juju administrators of this charm.
- Please help us out in ensuring easy to review branches by rebasing your pull
  request branch onto the `main` branch. This also avoids merge commits and
  creates a linear Git commit history.
